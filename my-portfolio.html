    <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>I am currently working at <strong>Airbnb</strong> as a Customer Experience Specialist. Prior to Airbnb, I spent 14 years working in Emergency Medicine as an Emergency Department Technician. Now that I have tasted the <em>sweet, juicy nectar</em> of tech, I want to expand my horizons and learn how to code.  I dream of one day working as a Product Designer, or perhaps as a Junior Developer.</p>
